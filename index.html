          The first 10 years of Alanâ€™s practice were spent in Vancouver where he developed his
          craft working with and against some of the best lawyers in the business.  Seeking a more
          balanced lifestyle, he then spent 16 years in the Cariboo where his clients included a
          major forestry company, small and medium sized resource based businesses, first nation
          bands, and people from all walks of life.  His early practice was a broad based litigation
          practice.  This included commercial, employment, real estate, estate, and family litigation.
          His litigation experience has given him a deep understanding of the ways in which
          misunderstandings and consequent expensive litigation can arise, even between well
          meaning individuals.  A resident of Penticton since 2007, his practice has, for the
          past several years, been focused on solicitors work.  This includes company law,
          commercial law, wills, estates and real estate.  He believes that thoughtful and careful
          planning is essential to avoid misunderstandings and disputes in the future.  He is
          committed to providing his clients with practical long term solutions.
